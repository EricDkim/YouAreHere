TODO & NOTES

TODO:
- Rotate the google maps pull of each building so it lines up with the screen
- Fix the IndoorAtlas bugs
	- HIGH
- I need to create the bitmap? || section the rooms of the SVG image
	- HIGH
		- import a new image (SVG) of the building
- When the user goes back and tries to go to a different map, the map should be cleared and should not pull up the previous mapping. 



NOTES:
- Found out that by just click 'Set Position' a few times it will load up the map from the indoorAtlas server
