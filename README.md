## About
	- You Are Here is a Indoor GPS navigation app constructed by using the IndoorAtlas API, 
	Google Maps API and the Cordova Platform. For students and faculty who have attended 
	Georgia Gwinnett College, if you have gotten lost trying to find a room, then this 
	application is for you. Input the building, floor and the room number and you are on your 
	way to find your destination fairly quickly. Since we are using Cordova, we can push the 
	application quickly to an Android or iOS build without changing any code. 

### Requirements API and Frameworks
1. Google Maps
2. Cordova
	Android Build 5.0
3. JQuery Mobile 1.4.5

### IndoorAtlas Account Access
	- To access the IndoorAtlas account, please contact Eric at dkim3@ggc.edu for the account information.

### How to develop
	- If you want to change the scripts, work under ../www/js/. If you wish to work and edit
	 the HTML, work under ../www/html/. 
	- When adding new buildigns and floor plan (SVG) please create new html files, since each 
	building/floor plan will require the svg to be embeded within the HTML.
	- Follow the jQuery mobile framework to make the application astehtically pleasing.
	- Plugins contain the cordova plugins, such as the spinner and the essential IndoorAtlas
	 plugin. 
	- Essentaily, you as the developer should not be touching the platforms unless you are 
	proficent at eding a previously built andoird application.
