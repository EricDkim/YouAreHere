## About
	- You Are Here is a Indoor GPS navigation app constructed by using the IndoorAtlas API, 
	Google Maps API and the Cordova Platform. For students and faculty who have attended 
	Georgia Gwinnett College, if you have gotten lost trying to find a room, then this 
	application is for you. Input the building, floor and the room number and you are on your 
	way to find your destination fairly quickly. Since we are using Cordova, we can push the application quickly to an Android or iOS build without changing any code.
